      <h1>Thumb list</h1>
      <p>
        Let's go now a bit deeper in the carousel world and let's add some
        thumbnails:
      </p>
      <UseSpringCarouselThumbListExample />
      <p>Again, things are easier:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Add <strong>withThumbs: true</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the property <strong>renderThumb</strong> like you do with{" "}
          <strong>renderItem</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Destructure the thumbs fragment - <strong>thumbsFragment</strong> -
          and use it wherever you want!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As you can see, the thumbs wrapper will automatically scroll; the logic
        applied is that it will try to put the <strong>active item</strong> in
        the center of the container. Of course, if you want to, you can manually
        scroll since the scroll behavior is the default browser one.
      </p>
      <HighlightText type="warning">
        <strong>Note:</strong> Since the library don't use any css library (the
        only styles that the library applies are inlined), if you want to hide
        the thumbs scrollBar, you'll have to do it by yourselve.
      </HighlightText>
      <p>
        You can also disable the automatic scroll of the thumbs if you desire
        to; in case, just pass <strong>enableThumbsWrapperScroll: false</strong>
      </p>
      <h2>Slide to item</h2>
      <p>
        I know, let me guess: if you click on a thumb nothing happens, right?
        Yeah, that goes against the common pattern, that <strong>should</strong>{" "}
        slide the carousel to the clicked item. But as you may already know, I
        don't like to force people to act in a particular way; instead, I give
        total freedom to the developer who will, if is the case, replicate that
        pattern. But how? Check the next example üòè
      </p>
      <UseSpringCarouselThumbListExample2 />
      <h2>prepareThumbsData</h2>
      <p>
        Let's say you want to display a beautiful high-quality images carousel;
        maybe you'll need to show images in buckets of 10 and, eventually, if
        the user wants to, load more and more images. If that's the case, well,{" "}
        <strong>React Spring Carousel</strong> makes it easy for you.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>useSpringCarousel</strong> hook has a property,{" "}
        <strong>prepareThumbsData</strong>, a function that receives the list of
        thumbs as the only argument, and it <strong>must</strong> return a list
        of thumbs as well. <strong>prepareThumbsData</strong> is executed before
        the rendering of the thumbs, so you can easily manipulate the list of
        items by adding or removing some items.
      </p>
      <HighlightText>
        If the number of items change, and the new items are less than the
        previous one (it means that we remove some items), the carousel will
        automatically set as active the last existing item. Pretty cool uh? üòé
